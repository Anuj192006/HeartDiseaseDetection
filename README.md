❤️ Heart Disease Prediction — Mini ML Project

This is a mini machine learning project built to explore how ML models can be applied to real-world healthcare datasets.
The goal was to understand the end-to-end ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to simple deployment — rather than to build a production-grade system.

What this project demonstrates

Practical application of supervised machine learning (classification)

Use of train-test split for model evaluation

Hands-on experience with feature-based prediction

Basic model deployment using Streamlit for interactive usage

Curiosity-driven learning and experimentation with ML concepts

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

Streamlit (for UI)

Jupyter Notebook (experimentation & analysis)

Why this project?

This project was built as a learning-focused mini project to show interest in machine learning fundamentals and real-world datasets.
It reflects my enthusiasm for exploring ML concepts alongside my primary focus on frontend and full-stack development.
