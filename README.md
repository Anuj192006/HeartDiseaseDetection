# Heart Disease Prediction App (Mini ML Project)

This is a mini machine learning project built to explore how ML models can be applied to real-world healthcare datasets.  
The goal is to understand the end-to-end ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to simple deployment.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Supervised machine learning (classification)
- Train-test split for model evaluation
- Feature-based medical prediction
- Basic deployment using Streamlit
- Genuine interest in machine learning fundamentals

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)  
- Streamlit  
- Jupyter Notebook
